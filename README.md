# BottleCaps

## Summary
Bottle caps is an script which uses computer vision *(mainly OpenCV)* among other algorithms to detect and match bottle caps from a databse. *Currently only works locally but the plan is to make it work with AWS servers with a lambda function.* It uses the following OpenCV methods: __Simple Blob Detector__, __Hough Transform Circles__ and __Scale-Invariant Feature Transform__. Also a different preprocess on every step of the image is necessary.
